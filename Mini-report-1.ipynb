    "#### Discussion\n",
    "The Bisection Method algorithm can be applied to all of the functions defined above to find the root of the function. It is a good method to use for any function as it will always converge to the root within 30 iterations. It will always converge to the nearest root as it takes the largest value plotted for the function and the lowest value plotted for the function and finds the midpoint between these two points then sets l or u to the midpoint so that the upper and lower values still have oppisite signs. There is a possibility that it will converge to a value that is not a root only if the actual root of the function is not roughly half way in between the upper and lower values. Therefore, when using the Bisection Method algorithm a very specific range must be stated and must also be small and close to where the root is to get a more accurate result. This is why the graphs of all the functions were plotted at the beginning of this notebook to roughly estimate in which range the root of the function lies in. It is also possible for the root in the initial range to not be found because if the range of limits are not close enough to the root it may converge to the upper limit. \n"

    "For function e(x) it converges to the root very slowly and takes over 1000 iterations. The while loop in the prevents the code to print more than 1000 values for the root, however we can see that it is converging because every iteration printed gets closer to the real root of the function. If the code allowed more than 1000 iterations it will eventually converge to the root. \n"

    "#### Discussion\n",
    "The Newton Raphson Method algorithm can be applied to all of the functions defined above to find the root of the function. It is not possible to predict how many iterations the functions will require to get to the value of the root. It will always converge to the nearest root as it takes the tangent of the line at a specified x value and labels the value at which the tangent line crosses the x axis as the next x value then draws another tangent line and so on. This method ensures that it will converge to the correct value for the root of the function. Like the Bisection Method and the Regula Falsi algorithm, this method also requires a very specific range must be stated and must also be small and close to where the root is to get a more accurate result.It is not possible for the root in the initial range to not be found because the method ensures that tangents are drawn until it gets close enough to the value for the root. \n",
    "The Newton Raphson algorithm is a quick method to find the root of a function that you roughly know the root of, meaning that if this method is used, a small range must be used where the root of the function is definately known to be within that small range. The starting values of x (x0) must also be close to the root as seen in the code for printing newton_raphson() for each function. In most cases (for functions a(x), c(x), f(x) and g(x)) the initial value of x (x0) cannot be set to zero as this would result in a zero division error.\n"
